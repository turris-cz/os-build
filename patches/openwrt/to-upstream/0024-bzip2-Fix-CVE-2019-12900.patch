+Subject: [PATCH] Accept as many selectors as the file format allows.
+
+But ignore any larger than the theoretical maximum, BZ_MAX_SELECTORS.
+
+The theoretical maximum number of selectors depends on the maximum
+blocksize (900000 bytes) and the number of symbols (50) that can be
+encoded with a different Huffman tree. BZ_MAX_SELECTORS is 18002.
+
+But the bzip2 file format allows the number of selectors to be encoded
+with 15 bits (because 18002 isn't a factor of 2 and doesn't fit in
+14 bits). So the file format maximum is 32767 selectors.
+
+Some bzip2 encoders might actually have written out more selectors
+than the theoretical maximum because they rounded up the number of
+selectors to some convenient factor of 8.
+
+The extra 14766 selectors can never be validly used by the decompression
+algorithm. So we can read them, but then discard them.
+
+This is effectively what was done (by accident) before we added a
+check for nSelectors to be at most BZ_MAX_SELECTORS to mitigate
+CVE-2019-12900.
+
+The extra selectors were written out after the array inside the
+EState struct. But the struct has extra space allocated after the
+selector arrays of 18060 bytes (which is larger than 14766).
+All of which will be initialized later (so the overwrite of that
+space with extra selector values would have been harmless).
